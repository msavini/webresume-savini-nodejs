                        <p>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hello reader! I created this page to give anyone who's interested a brief glimpse into my life so far. I'll be updating this page appropriately as time goes on, but I thought it would be nice to share a little bit about myself in an autobiographical form. While I am going to talk about some of my accomplishments, and keep my wording fairly formal for readability, this is going to be a relatively informal and limited account; ideally, it will highlight some of the events in my life that I believe shaped who I am today.

                        <h3>Early Life</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I grew up in a small town in rural New York. Geographically, not far from New York City, but culturally, one couldn't be further. Like most people, I don't remember many specifics from back then, but I do know that at a young age I was fortunate enough to be introduced to two of my biggest passions:<br> <b>music</b> and <b>technology</b>.
                            <br><br>
                            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When I was 8 years old, I got my first computer. Ever since then, I've grown up with the technology that our society utilizes on a daily basis. I considered my computer to be an extension of myself, and this deep love for computers has continued to flourish as my academic career has progressed. Whenever I had the opportunity to work with a computer, I took it. Essays? Typed. Presentations? Filmed and edited.
                            <br><br>
                            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Equally relevant to my love for technology is my desire for self expression. I have always been interested in the creative process. In elementary school, I didn't spend as much time playing video games as my peers, but my lack of time spent was not due to lack of interest; I just preferred to spend my time being creative. I don't mean to sound vague, that's just the only way to describe it. My passion was for creation. Whether it was writing, composing, painting, drawing, building, programming, filming, editing, or even cooking... You name it, I've tried it.
                            <br><br>
                            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To satisfy this urge to be creative in my later years, I turned to the most accessible form of expression I could find, and with an absolutely stellar Music Department right in my local school district, it seemed almost predestined that music should be my creative outlet of choice. I had started my elementary musical journey playing flute (believe it or not), but it wasn't until I switched to studying the alto saxophone that my love for music really became prominent.

                        <h3>Academic Life &amp; Achievements</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Throughout my entire academic career, my main focus was <b>maintaining balance</b>. I tried to actively distribute my efforts evenly amongst my academic endeavors, my musical performances, my athletic activities, and my social life. 
                        <br><br>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Academically speaking, my philosophy was always to make sure that the work I submitted was something of which I could be proud to call my own. I completed work above and beyond what I thought was good enough to succeed, and I have never regretted taking that approach towards anything in my life. In high school, I was an inducted member of the <b>National Honor Society</b> and graduated 5th in my class. For my efforts, I received an <b>Academic Excellence Award in English and Instrumental Music</b>. In my senior year, I was selected out of my class of 300 students to take part in a committee focused on improving the educational experience for future Wallkill students.
                        <br><br>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In high school, I was heavily involved in athletics as well. In each sport, I tried to lead by example while maintaining a competitive edge. I began my young athletic career playing soccer, but unfortunately, my soccer career was cut short due to injury. Luckily, with the help of months of physical therapy, I made a full recovery, but I was advised to stop playing soccer. I was devastated, but I decided that this was only a minor setback, and that I would run Cross Country next season. By the end of my athletic career, I had been named Captain of the Varsity Track and Field team, as well as the Cross Country Team, winning <b>4</b> Coach's Awards and Rookie of the Year along the way. Participating in competitive sports taught me many valuable lessons about facing adversity, leadership, teamwork, and loyalty, and I continue to approach my life with these lessons in mind each day.
                        <br><br>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With regards to my musical involvements, I was an active member of the Concert Band, Wind Ensemble, Jazz Band, and eventually the Musical Ensemble in the pit for the Drama club. In each ensemble that I joined, I became section leader for my section. At the end of my musical career, I was awarded the <b>John Philip Sousa Band Award</b> for my efforts.

                        <p>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After high school, I decided to study Computer Systems Engineering at <b>Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute</b>. In my second year, I decided to switch my major to Computer Science, and with the extra leniency my program provided, I pursued extended education in Music. This was my way of maintaining balance and keeping my mind active in different ways during my pursuit of higher education.
                        <br><br>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the time I spent studying at Rensselaer, I learned many valuable lessons from my academic and social experiences. The unending balancing act of life, education, and leisure was both a daunting and exciting task at the same time: something that I never would have truly understood if I had not taken that leap by pursuing higher education.
                        <br><br>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My time spent studying music and the arts of the last few centuries broadened my perspective of modern culture, thus allowing me to approach my artistic endeavors with a deeper understanding of the works that influenced my tastes. Collaborative projects with my peers expanded my perspective even further; collaborating with other artists from differing backgrounds was an opportunity to discuss different ways to approach the process of creating impactful and meaningful musical works.
                        <br> <br>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I joined the Greek Community, and from my brothers in the <b>Gamma Epsilon Chapter of Tau Kappa Epsilon Fraternity</b>, I learned to practice the values of love, charity, and esteem. We worked together, we studied together, and through the hardest times we stuck together; the men that I call my brothers instilled in me a new understanding of loyalty and brotherhood that I will always try to uphold in everything I do in my life.
